# ArtSci 2019 Average Face Project

The basic idea is a vertical screen showing a portrait which is an
average of a bunch of faces.  The faces are pictures taken from
visitors of the exhibition.

Besides the screen there is a camera, where people can have their
picture taken and added to the average.

## Setup

### Hardware

- FullHD Screen
  - Hopefully provided by the ETHZ
- FullHD camera

### Software

- Needs to display a fullscreen image
- Needs to show a smaller image in the bottom of the frame, which is
  the life image from the camera
- Needs to read out the image data from the camera and show it on the
  screen
- ML part: Needs to extract the face from the picture
