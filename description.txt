Title: Face of the Crowd

Description:

The idea behind the project is to convey fascination of technology,
where the individual elements are well understood but the result still
seems magical.

The installation recreates the crowds portrait by combining the
individual viewers features.  A camera takes pictures of the passing
viewers, which are then merged together.  The displayed image adjusts
to the new faces over time, the visitor changes the exhibit by viewing
it.

The merging is based on 68 landmarks in the picture positioned in the
eyes, the eyebrows, the nose, the mouth and chin, which are identified
with facial recognition software.

Each landmark position is morphed towards the average positon for that
landmark, calculated from all pictures.  In this way the individual
pictures are morphed together, forming the face of the crowd.
